        <p class="about-me">
            My name is Ebrahim Momin<br>
            I am 10 years old<br>
            My favorite hobby is coding<br>
            I am pretty good at math, and science too<br>
            I learned how to code on Codecademy<br>
            I first learned how to code on Khan Academy<br>
            But I never use the programming skills I learned on Khan Academy<br>
            But because of Khan Academy I got interested in coding<br>
            But now I use Codecademy<br>
            I would highly recomend both<br>
            Khan Academy and Codecademy<br>
            And Codecademy Pro is 100% worth it<br>

          This is going to be a store later, but I<br>
          need to learn JavaScript/SQL before I can turn it into a store<br>
